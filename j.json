This book considers the basic aspects of this complex problem - the historical and social essence of language and thought, their interaction in historical evolution, the essence of linguistic meaning in relation to the content side of thought, and the physiological mechanism of the processes of abstraction, generalization, etc. " },
{   "id" : "478", "doc" :"Concept Organization for Information Retrieval Farradane, J. All analysis of information for storage and of questions for effecting retrieval must be in terms of concepts and the relations between them. The concepts may be just words (descriptors), as in simple post-co-ordinate keyword indexing systems, or they may be class-terms or other idea-groupings, as in classifications.  The relations between concepts often appear to be absent, but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there is clearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer or questioner, and other relations possible between the words would lead to false drops.  Classification has traditionally been a method of organization of concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayed in the form of groupings called classes. " },
{   "id" : "480", "doc" :"Some Structural Characteristics of Articulated Subject Indexes Armitage, Janet E. Lynch, Michael F. An articulated subject index is one in which logical transformations of natural language phrases containing prepositions or connectives are employed to organize the noun phrases as subject headings, with subordinate displays of the remainder of the phrases.. The best-known example of the articulated subject index is that to Chemical Abstracts.. It has been shown that a well-defined transformation links the entry, as it appears in the index, with the original phrase, in natural order, as it was first compiled by the indexer.. A reverse transformation can be used to generate potential index entries from indexing phrases containing one or more prepositions or connectives.. A simple model has been devised for the generation of articulated subject index entries from natural language indexing phrases which exclude infinitives or words acting as gerunds or participles.. A sorting algorithm has also been developed, the purpose of which is to select those entries which lead to greatest organization in the index display.. Deviations from the model in manually-produced indexes are described.. The potential value of certain of these characteristics in information retrieval is examined.. " },
{   "id" : "481", "doc" :"Integrated Information Processing and the Case for a National Network Dammers, H. F. The various premises, which need consideration when developing a realistic and flexible information storage, retrieval and dissemination (ISRD) system, are discussed; their implication is illustrated with some examples from the development of the system at \"Shell\" Research, Sittingbourne.. One of the factors which will affect the satisfactory performance of an ISRD system is the ease with which relevant literature information not held in the system can be provided.. The later part of the paper is developed to a discussion of this problem and of a possible means of dealing with it in the not too distant future.. " },

A small-scale, computer-based SDI system in plasma physics and the related subjects is described briefly.. The system serves about 100 research scientists and engineers and uses title input only in order to minimize input costs.. The implications of this approach and its effect upon the system parameters is discussed.. Some comparison of the costs of the computer-based system with those of a manual system is made.. Further experiments are described in which the service is expanded to external users on a world-wide basis, the aim being to compare, under controlled conditions, the parameters of the small-scale internal service with those of an external service on a wide scale.. The paper concludes with some observations on the future development and organization of computer-assisted services, their possibilities and the main problems which are likely to arise.. " },
{   "id" : "483", "doc" :"Performance of Automatic Information Systems Lesk, Michael E. The SMART document retrieval system is used to investigate algorithms for text analysis and request searching.. Results from three document collections indicate that word normalization is efficiently performed by automatic thesaurus lookup, while phrase matching procedures, statistical association methods, and concept hierarchies are useful for special applications.. Automatic document clustering schemes and use-interactive feedback methods permit rapid searches of large collections.. Abstracts are found to be superior to titles as a base for content analysis in a document retrieval system and almost as good as complete texts.. Proper procedures for designing dictionaries and searching requests are discussed..The practicality of large scale document centers and their proper design are considered in light of these results..

{   "id" : "484", "doc" :"Negotiation of Inquiries in an On-Line Retrieval System Hillman, Donald J. The focus of discussion is a prototype retrieval system with three major components for text processing, connectivity and decision operations.. Each of these components is based on a distinguishable subtheory.. Computer programs for the first two components have been written for a GE 225 computer.. The complete prototype system is now being programmed for operation in a time-shared environment.. It is a user-oriented system, with planned capabilities for the browsing and man-machine interaction.. A major goal is to develop procedures whereby research workers can conduct an on-line dialog via terminals with a body of scientific information.. Each user-submitted inquiry is a set of sentences without restriction as to vocabulary or form.. The system converses with the user to obtain source-derived phrases that elaborate and refine the initial inquiry.. The use is led to browse in the general area of his inquiry and to broaden or narrow it as a further aid to request formulation.. Evaluation of system performance is described.. " },

{   "id" : "486", "doc" :"Relevance Assessments and Retrieval System Evaluation Lesk, M. E. Salton, G. Two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information retrieval system are, respectively, the recall and the precision.. Since the determination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documents which are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to that query, it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate, generally valid evaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures.. A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall and precision.. It thus appears that properly computed recall and precision data may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many distinct user classes.. " },
{   "id" : "487", "doc" :"An Indirect Method of Information Retrieval Goffman, William The information retrieval process, treated strictly as a matching procedure, has the defects that tha whole file must be probed for each query, and that it overlooks the fact that the relevance of the information from one document depends upon what is already known about the subject, and in term affects the relevance of other documents subsequently examined.. A mathematical model of a search technique in which the defects of the direct method are taken into account is demonstrated by an experiment in which a given paper is treated as an enquiry and the references cited in the paper are treated as relevant answers.. The results in two tests show much better results than those achieved by the direct method.. No spurious material was retrieved by either method.. " }
